## Winterfest

This set of snippets expands to breweries represented at the Brewers of Indiana Guild Winterfest. Each abbreviation is prefixed with `bb`. The next three letters of the abbreviation are the first three letters of the first word in the brewery name. The final letter of the abbreviation is the first letter of the second word in the brewery name. Here are some examples:

    Sun King Brewing Company == bb + sun + k == bbunk
    Triton Brewing Company   == bb + tri + b == bbtrib

The goal is predictable abbreviations so it's easy to guess the abbreviation when you know the full brewery name. This system should speed up taking notes on beers you're tasting at the festival.
